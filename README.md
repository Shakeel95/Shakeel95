### Hello! üëãüèæ

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am a PhD student in Statistics at LSE supervised by [Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/). My academic interests mostly concern multiscale methods for detecting changepoints in time series data.

---

I‚Äôm currently working on two PhD projects...
  * Inference for changepoints in piecewise polynomials
  * Recovering causal structures in change point regressions
  
Upcoming talks and conferences...
  * I will give a talk at the [Advanced Statistical Seminar, Charles University Prague](https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~maciak/StS2023.php) in late March

This year (2022/23) I am the GTA for...
  * [ST310 Machine Learning](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST310.htm)
  * [ST304 Time Series and Forecasting](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST304.htm)
  * [ST226 Actuarial Investigations (Financial)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST226.htm)

Outside of my PhD work I...
  * Help to organize the [stats PhD reading group](https://lse-stats-phd-reading-group.github.io/)
  * Am part of the [LSE Black PhD students network](https://twitter.com/LseMwangaza)
