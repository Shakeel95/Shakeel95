### Hello! üëãüèæ

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am a PhD student in Statistics at LSE supervised by [Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/). My academic interests mostly concern multiscale methods for detecting change points in time series data.

---

I‚Äôm currently working on two projects...
  * Robust inference for change points in piecewise polynomials
  * Recovering causal structures in change point regressions
  
Upcoming talks and conferences...
  * I will be at the [CMStatistics](http://www.cmstatistics.org/CMStatistics2023/) session "structured multivariate and functional data" this December

Outside of my PhD work I...
  * Help to organize the [stats PhD reading group](https://lse-stats-phd-reading-group.github.io/)
  * Am part of the [LSE Black PhD students network](https://twitter.com/LseMwangaza)

Still here? Why not listen to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN8M2irJVJA).
