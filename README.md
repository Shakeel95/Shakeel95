### Hello! üëãüèæ

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am a PhD student in Statistics at LSE supervised by [Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/). My academic interests mostly concern multiscale methods for detecting change points in time series data.

I‚Äôm currently working on ...
  * Some non-parametric change point problems in stochastic frontier analysis
  * An online procedure for detecting the onset of unit roots
  
Upcoming talks and conferences...
  * I will give a talk at the [HiTEc Spring workshop](https://www.cmstatistics.org/hiteccodes2024/index.php) session on "theoretical and computational aspects of complex data models"

Outside of my PhD work I...
  * Help to organize the [stats PhD reading group](https://lse-stats-phd-reading-group.github.io/)
  * Am part of the [LSE Black PhD students network](https://twitter.com/LseMwangaza)

Still here? Why not listen to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3qx1hcBq1U).
