### Hello! üëãüèæ

Welcome to Shakeel's little corner of GitHub. I am a PhD student in Statistics at LSE supervised by [Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/). My academic interests mostly concern multiscale methods for detecting changepoints in time series data.

I‚Äôm currently working on two PhD projects...
  - Detecting misaligned changepoints in panel data
  - Robust inference for changepoints in piecewise polynomials

This year (2021/22) I am the GTA for...
  * [ST310 Machine Learning](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST310.htm)
  * [ST304 Time Series and Forecasting](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST304.htm)

News... 
  * I will be sharing my perspective on the academic experience at the LSE's [Black Achievement Conference](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Undergraduate/widening-participation/Sixth-form-college/black-achievement-conference-year-12)
  * I am happy to have been awarded a [travel grant to attend ICORS 2022](https://uwaterloo.ca/international-conference-robust-statistics/awards)

Upcoming talks...
  * I will be presenting at the [IMS 2022](https://www.imsannualmeeting-london2022.com/) session on "Inference on Change Points"
  * I will be presenting at the [ICORS 2022](https://uwaterloo.ca/international-conference-robust-statistics/) session on "Robust change point analysis and regression"
  * I will be presenting at the [JSM 2022](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2022/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=322376) session on "Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science"

Outside of my PhD work I...
  * Help to organize the [stats PhD reading group](https://lse-stats-phd-reading-group.github.io/)
  * Am part of the [LSE Black PhD students network](https://twitter.com/LseMwangaza)
